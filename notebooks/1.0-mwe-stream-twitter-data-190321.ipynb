    "We filter data to identify health tweets. Keyword filtering, which is used to obtain the data, is insufficient; e.g., ‚ÄúI'm sick of this‚Äù and ‚Äújustin beber ur so cool and i have beber fever.‚Äù [8] Instead, we rely on supervised machine learning classification to filter tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We filtered tweets from 2009‚Äì2010 with 20,000 keyphrases and randomly annotated a subset of the remaining 11.7 million tweets using Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing service, [30]‚Äì[31] to distinguish relevant health tweets from spurious matches. Workers annotated examples as positive (about the user‚Äôs health), negative (unrelated, e.g. news updates or advertisements, or not English), or ambiguous. To ensure quality, we annotated a sample ourselves and required workers to annotate some of these ‚Äúgold‚Äù tweets, which allowed us to check annotator accuracy and exclude inaccurate workers. Second, each tweet was labeled by three annotators and the final label was determined by majority vote, removing the 1.1% of examples where the majority vote was ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "This yielded a set of 5,128 tweets (36.1% positive) for training data to create a classifier for health relevance. We trained a binary logistic regression model using the MALLET toolkit [32] with n-gram (1‚â§n‚â§3) word features. We tokenized the raw text such that contiguous blocks of punctuation were treated as word separators, with punctuation blocks retained as word tokens. We removed tweets containing URLs, which were almost always false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tuned the prediction threshold using 10-fold cross validation to result in an estimated 68% precision and 72% recall, a balance of precision and recall. Applying this classifier to the health stream yielded 144 million health tweets, a nearly hundred-fold increase over our earlier study of 1.6 million tweets. [24]."

    "Various cancer-causing substances are associated with primary liver cancer, including certain herbicides and chemicals such as vinyl chloride and arsenic. Smoking, especially if you abuse alcohol as well, also increases risk. Aflatoxins, cancer-causing substances made by a type of plant mold, have also been implicated. Aflatoxins can contaminate wheat, peanuts, rice, corn, and soybeans. These are rare problems in most developed countries like the U.S. Other causes include the hormones androgen and estrogen and a dye formerly used in medical tests called thorotrast."
